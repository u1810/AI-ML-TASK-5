# AI-ML-TASK-5
AI & ML Internship - Task 5: Decision Trees and Random Forests
Objective
To implement and evaluate tree-based machine learning models ‚Äî Decision Tree and Random Forest ‚Äî using the Heart Disease Dataset. This task focuses on:

Reducing overfitting in decision trees
Comparing with ensemble methods like Random Forest
Visualizing the decision-making process
Interpreting feature importance
Using cross-validation for robust evaluation
 Dataset
File Name: heart.csv
Records: 1025 patient records
Target Variable: target
1 ‚Üí Heart Disease Present
0 ‚Üí No Heart Disease
Tools & Technologies
Google Colab (Recommended)
Python
Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
‚úÖ Features Implemented
1Ô∏è‚É£ Decision Tree Classifier
Trained with max_depth=4 to control overfitting
Visualized using plot_tree() for interpretability
Evaluated using accuracy and classification metrics
2Ô∏è‚É£ Random Forest Classifier
Trained with 100 decision trees (n_estimators=100)
Significantly higher performance than single decision tree
Feature importances extracted and visualized
3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Importance Plot
Identifies key medical features like cp, thalach, oldpeak, and ca
4Ô∏è‚É£ Cross-Validation
Used 5-fold cross-validation to ensure robust model performance
üìä Results Summary
Model	Accuracy	Cross-Validation Accuracy
Decision Tree	80.00%	83.41%
Random Forest	98.54% ‚úÖ	99.71% ‚úÖ
‚úÖ Random Forest outperformed Decision Tree in both accuracy and stability.
